# LM2Randomiser

To use the randomiser place the folder in the root folder of your La Mulana 2 installation. For first time you'll need to use the mod dll function once, though should be ok if its ran again. Then just generate the seed, running this again currently overrides the current seed so be careful.

Notes currently only options are choosing to randomise the grail and scanner, current items in the randomisation pool are all the treasure boxes, free standing items, shop items and npc items. Also currently the the item you get after the funeral, mulbruks item and the secret treasure item spot will not containing a required item to beat the game.
