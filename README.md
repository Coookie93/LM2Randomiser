Notes currently only options are choosing to randomise the grail and scanner, current items in the randomisation pool are all the treasure box items, free standing items, shop items and npc items. Currently the the item you get after the funeral, mulbruks item and the secret treasure item spot will not containing a required item to beat the game. 

The logic for bosses/minibosses needs some work along with the item pricing.
