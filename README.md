# LM2Randomiser

To use the randomiser place the folder in the root folder of your La Mulana 2 installation(the folder with the La Mulana 2 exe). For first time you'll need to use the mod dll function once which makes a back-up of the original, though should be ok if its ran again. Then just generate the seed, running this again currently overrides the current seed so be careful. 

To remove have to manually put the back-up in managed folder, alternatively could just use steams file verification, then you can remove the randomiser.

Notes currently only options are choosing to randomise the grail and scanner, current items in the randomisation pool are all the treasure box items, free standing items, shop items and npc items. Currently the the item you get after the funeral, mulbruks item and the secret treasure item spot will not containing a required item to beat the game. 

The logic for bosses/minibosses needs some work along with the item pricing.
